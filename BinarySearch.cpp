/* Some important questions in binary search

1. Binary search - with equality comparison
2. Without equalality comparison -
   - flooring the mid element and return l in the end,
   - capping the mid element and return r in the end.
3. What to return when key is not found in search - (-1 or closest element? lesser or greater)
4. Duplicates
   - return any match
   - return leftmost
   - return rightmost
   - both
5. return exact match or least greater than (upper bound) the key element in case match not found
6. return exact match or greatest element to left (lower bound) of match in case match not found
7. Return k closest elements to match
8. Find the element in rotated sorted array
9. Find the lowest element of rotated sorted array
10. Find element closest in Binary search tree


Test cases:  odd and even, visualize with 3, 2, 1 elements - exact match and no match
